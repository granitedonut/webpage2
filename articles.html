What are the best sneaker brands? The answer is kind of complicated. The sneaker market is vast and multi-varied, and, let's face it, "best" is a tad too definitive. We could rattle off a list of the largest sneaker brands by sales per square foot or some other arbitrary metric of commercial success, but bigger isn't always better. (Though, yes, some of the biggest sneaker brands in the world also happen to be some of the best.) In the sneaker game, cult-loved boutique labels routinely go toe to toe with billion-dollar sportswear behemoths in a cutthroat competition for sneakerhead attention—that's what makes keeping track of it all such a blast.

So what truly separates the companies making waves in the sneaker space from the names that could drop a new silhouette overnight without the internet making a peep? A longstanding history of innovation always helps. A deep roster of beloved retro styles to fall back on never hurts. Above all else, though, a reputation for consistently providing a high-quality product tends to do the trick, whether you're hawking running shoes available at every Foot Locker in the world or high-end, limited-edition kicks that resell for quadruple their asking price.

So consider this, if not a definitive list, then at least a comprehensive breakdown of who's who and what's what in today's sneaker market. Below you'll find 22 of the best sneaker brands you need to know—including the requisite Nike, Adidas, and New Balance shoutouts—along with a whole bunch of styles they're famous for. From Italian-made suede low-tops to dependable canvas high-tops, one of these brands is guaranteed to have what you need. 

Don’t miss GQ’s definitive guide to everything kicks—from the types of sneakers always worth copping to the best ways to score the next hot drop.</p>

<h1><u>80's Shoes</u></h1>
<p>A couple of years back, when Puma Basketball first began plotting its comeback, the brand’s then-unannounced creative director Jay-Z provided some helpful direction. “It’s all about Clyde,” Hov told Adam Petrick, Puma’s global director of brand and marketing. Wise words: the Clyde in question, of course, is Walt “Clyde” Frazier, the Knicks legend—and arguably the biggest fit god the NBA has ever seen—who Puma blessed with the first-ever signature basketball sneaker in 1973, over a decade before Nike signed Jordan. Even during Puma’s 20-year hiatus from the hardwood, the OG Clyde remained one of the German giant’s biggest sellers, and two of its four performance hoops models now bear its name: the Clyde Hardwood and Clyde Court.

But it’s tough to establish any real credibility in the fickle, Swoosh-dominated world of basketball shoes on the strength of a single sneaker alone—even one as iconic as the Clyde. Which is why, back in March, Puma splashily relaunched a near-forgotten gem from its archives: the Puma Majesty. Back in the ‘80s, the Majesty was the signature model for Rockets phenom Ralph Sampson, who came roaring into the league as the most dynamic rookie of his era: a 7’4” center with the handles and playmaking of a point guard, Sampson was a precursor to the Giannis-type unicorns running rampant in today’s NBA. Much like the player it was designed for, the mid-top Majesty was ahead of its time, less clunky and more agile than its heavy-soled competitors.<br><br>

Despite the fond memories, Sampson and Puma fell out of touch for decades after his career ended in 1991. When the brand first reached out last year about potentially bringing back his shoes, Sampson jokes that he only had one real question: How’d you get this number? Since hammering out the details, though, it’s been a pretty wild ride for the Hall of Famer: the Majesty is now officially the Puma Ralph Sampson, putting his name back in the headlines in a meaningful way for the first time in a long while. Sampson says he now gets upwards of 20 pieces of mail a day at his house from people who remember wearing his sneakers from the first go-round, thanking him for bringing them back and asking for signatures. And Puma has been sending over new styles for Sampson’s mom to test out and review—like the freshly-dropped Ralph Sampson Lo Wild, an extremely-on-trend zebra-print joint that got the octogenarian’s coveted stamp of approval.<br><br>
With another NBA season already underway, and rising stars such as RJ Barrett turning out in cutting-edge Pumas, Sampson and his resurgent signature line will be holding things down from the other end, adding some much-needed weight to the company’s Clyde-centric basketball heritage. “These young guys need to understand that Puma has a history that no other brand has, starting with the Olympics all the way through to today,” Sampson says. “It means something.”

<p>Kanye West has gone on many infamous “rants,” or whatever he’d like us to call them now, but the one-two punch of his two-hour interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God and subsequent TMZ appearance on Tuesday probably takes the cake. He divulged that he’s had liposuction and gotten addicted to opioids, and topped it all off by suggesting that 400 years of slavery was “a choice.”

But sift through the objectively 1,000 percent wrong takes on U.S. history, and there are moments when Kanye lets us in on the state of his fashion empire: how his Nike deal crumbled, what his relationship with Adidas is like, an alleged partnership with luxury conglomerate LVMH that fell through at the final seconds and damaged his ability to make apparel, and why it’s important that Virgil Abloh landed the Louis Vuitton gig. Here’s everything you need to know.</p>
